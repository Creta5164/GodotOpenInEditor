**About:**
A simple plugin to enable the ability to quickly open folders in a desired code editor (any editor that accepts its launch command + the directory should work, I have only tested VSCode and Rider)

**Credits:**
This is adapted from a GDScript plugin made by Creta Park which was VSCode specific and be found here:https://gist.github.com/Creta5164/244fcb11a3b2d5d65ef196ca0e2d08ed#comments
I have rewrote the entire thing in GDScript while also removing the checks forcing VSCode only.
